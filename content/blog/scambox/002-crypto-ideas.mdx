Today I want to tell you the story of a business investor, amazing ideas, unregulated organ trading and ghosting.
So put on your seatbelts, grab your popcorn, we're jumping right into the chat-log!

<Chatbox open="bottom">
    <Chatmsg name="Megan">
        Hello
    </Chatmsg>
    <Chatmsg dir="out" name="Kevin">
        Hi
    </Chatmsg>
    <Chatmsg name="Megan">
        How's it going?
    </Chatmsg>
    <Chatmsg dir="out" name="Kevin">
        Can't complain, how about you?
    </Chatmsg>
</Chatbox>

I love when scammers do small talk. You can always notice how forced and fake it feels. 
Wasting time here is the most fun, because they just want to get to their scammy part, but have to warm you up first.

<Chatbox open="both">
    <Chatmsg name="Megan">
        I'm doing great too. I'm from New Jersey, where are you from?
    </Chatmsg>
    <Chatmsg dir="out" name="Kevin">
        Oh I'm from Germany, but I've got family in NJ!
    </Chatmsg>
</Chatbox>

It's not immoral to lie to scammer... right?

<Chatbox open="both">
    <Chatmsg name="Megan">
        Where does your family live?
    </Chatmsg>
    <Chatmsg dir="out" name="Kevin">
        Just south of Philly
    </Chatmsg>
    <Chatmsg name="Megan">
        I work at the coca cola company, but I'm also investing in crypto. What about you?
    </Chatmsg>
    <Chatmsg dir="out" name="Kevin">
        I do not work at the coca cola company.
    </Chatmsg>
    <Chatmsg name="Megan">
        Where do you work?
    </Chatmsg>
    <Chatmsg dir="out" name="Kevin">
        I work at a nightclub as a barkeeper
    </Chatmsg>
    <Chatmsg name="Megan">
        Do you make good money with that?
    </Chatmsg>
    <Chatmsg dir="out" name="Kevin">
        Can't complain, I recently inherited a huge sum of money
    </Chatmsg>
    <Chatmsg name="Megan">
        Have you thought about any business?
    </Chatmsg>
</Chatbox>

Oh Megan, you would not *believe* just how many amazing business ideas I have...

<Chatbox open="both">
    <Chatmsg dir="out" name="Kevin">
        Ok, hear me out...
        <hr/>
        Vapes, but cats and dogs can use them!
    </Chatmsg>
    <Chatmsg name="Megan">
        That sounds like a great idea.
    </Chatmsg>
</Chatbox>

No it absolutely does not, but she can't say that because she still wants me to invest in her crypto scam. ðŸ™‚

<Chatbox open="both">
    <Chatmsg name="Megan">
        Have you ever thought about crypto?
    </Chatmsg>
    <Chatmsg dir="out" name="Kevin">
        Actually I have. That is another business idea of mine
        <hr/>
        Organs, but they're NFTs! Right now there's the legal donation system, illegal black markets, everything is not very transparent.
        Now imagine every organ was an NFT!<br/><br/>
        Democratizing the Organ market one transaction at a time.
    </Chatmsg>

At this point Megan was ready to launch into her whole crypto spiel, and I just kinda tuned out. 
But appearently my idea would work perfectly with her investment opportunity!

<Chatbox open="top">
    <Chatmsg name="Megan">
        <Chatblah/><Chatblah/><Chatblah/>crypto investment<Chatblah/><Chatblah/> and I love NFTs <Chatblah/> looking into minting some. <Chatblah/><Chatblah/><Chatblah/><Chatblah/> and your NFTs could work with that! <Chatblah/><Chatblah/><Chatblah/><Chatblah/><Chatblah/> with my investment company based in Denmark!
    </Chatmsg>
    <Chatmsg dir="out" name="Kevin">
        Denmark? That's really close to where I live. Where exactly is the company, so I can go there and give them the money directly?
    </Chatmsg>
    <Chatmsg name="Megan">
        What do you mean? There is no need to travel
    </Chatmsg>
    <Chatmsg dir="out" name="Kevin">
        Oh it's no problem. It's really not far, and we can save on transaction fees if I bring the money directly!
    </Chatmsg>
    <Chatnotice>Megan has cleared the chat</Chatnotice>
</Chatbox>

Weird... Looks like Megan did not want me to visit her amazing investment company in Denmark... ðŸ˜¢
