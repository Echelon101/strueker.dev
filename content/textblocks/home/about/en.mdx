# Hello ğŸ‘‹

I am Timo StrÃ¼ker, an IT specialist and hobby developer from northern Germany. My interest in computers started when I was about seven years old, when I got my first PC with Windows 2000. Since 2016, I have been professionally involved with IT systems and in this context I have also developed my interest in programming. Currently I work for [GHD GesundHeits GmbH Deutschland](https://www.gesundheitsgmbh.de/) as IT-Administrator and build a company together with friends.
