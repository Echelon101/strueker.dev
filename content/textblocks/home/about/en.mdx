# Hello 👋

I am Timo Strüker, an IT specialist and hobby developer from northern Germany. My interest in computers started when I was about seven years old, when I got my first PC with Windows 2000. Since 2016, I have been professionally involved with IT systems and in this context I have also developed my interest in programming. Currently I work for [Netzplan](https://www.netzplan.de) in Customer Service and build two companies together with friends.
