# Hello ğŸ‘‹

I am Timo StrÃ¼ker, an IT specialist and hobby developer from northern Germany. My interest in computers started when I was about seven years old, when I got my first PC with Windows 2000. Since 2016 I have been working professionally with IT systems and in this context I have also developed my interest in programming.
