# About My photo management system

The system is built on four k3s nodes that run a number of containers that help me manage my photo collection

Stack:
 - Syncthing (ingest of image files)
 - multiple [photorism](https://photoprism.app) instances
    - Archive (All raw and jpg files)
    - Storage (Curated jpg files)
    - Family (Curated jpg files from my parents)
    - Other (Curated jpg files from friends)
 - an [Immich](https://immich.app) instance to perform face recognition and have a pleasing frontend
