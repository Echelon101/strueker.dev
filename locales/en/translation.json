I've learned operating computers very early in my life with my father giving me his old Windows 2000 tower. Some years later I've had my first contact with web development a few years later when I bought a book about HTML, PHP, JavaScript and CSS from a sale at my local library. From this point onwards web development has been a job and a hobby equally.",
