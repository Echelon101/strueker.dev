KevinK.dev is my personal page, now on Gatsby. I've chosen Gatsby as a framework as it offers me the speed of client-side-rendered pages with the compatibility and stability of a traditional server-side-rendered page. This is also the repo I try new stuff on, so feel free to look around and pick up some useful.

You may also want to take a look at [Unkn0wnCat/cfw-language-redirector](https://github.com/Unkn0wnCat/cfw-language-redirector) for the Cloudflare Worker used to redirect landing pages to their localized versions.
