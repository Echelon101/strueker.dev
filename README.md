Strueker.dev is my personal page. It's based on the active development effort by Kevin Kandlbinder [Unkn0wnCat/kevink.dev.js](https://github.com/Unkn0wnCat/kevink.dev.js)

You may also want to take a look at [Unkn0wnCat/cfw-language-redirector](https://github.com/Unkn0wnCat/cfw-language-redirector) for the Cloudflare Worker used to redirect landing pages to their localized versions.
